In the globe tossing example from the chapter saying "the probability of water is 0.7" tells us that
given all the information provided to our model this is the best prediction of reality, this prediction can also be updated when more information is provided.
The probability of water is based on a model and even if the model created is usefull there is still no guarantee that the model will match reality.
The globe has a certain amount of water on it and this is the objective reality.
The idea of a probability is that we are making a prediction on that state of reality.

Bayes Theorem states that Pr(Earth|Land)=Pr(Land|Earth)Pr(Earth)/Pr(Land)

Earth is 70% water so Pr(Land|Earth)=0.30

Mars is 100% Land so Pr(Land|Mars)=1

Earth and Mars are equally likely to be tossed so Pr(Earth)=0.5

Pr(Land)=Pr(Land|Earth)Pr(Earth)+ Pr(Land|Mars)Pr(Mars)=0.3(0.5)+1(0.5)=0.65

Therefore Pr(Earth|Land)=0.30(0.5)/0.65= 0.23

## 2M4
The number of ways to produce the data of a face up black card for each of the three cards:

    card 1(two black sides): 2 ways
    card 2(one black and one white side): 1 ways
    card 3(two white sides): 0 ways
    
Dividing the number of ways for card 1 by the total number of ways we get:

pr(card 1)=pr(other side is also black)=2 ways/3 total ways= 2/3
